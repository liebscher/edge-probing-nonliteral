Kondratieff presented few data for growth from 1789 to 1814 from countries other than Britain because they had little growth to analyse.

Lee visited Hong Kong in January 1990, when he expressed doubts about the feasibility of introducing democratic structures before assimilation by China in 1997.
The &quot; one country, two systems &quot; concept agreed by China was based on Hong Kong's colonial administration system rather than on parliamentary democracy, he warned.
Taken along with his restrained reaction to the repression of the pro-democracy movement in China itself &lsqb; see pp. 36720-22 &rsqb;, his attitude gave rise to some suggestions that he saw a role for himself as a potential mediator in the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-event"> Hong Kong </location></annot> issue.

On one level the sudden and unexpected friendship thrives on little more than mutual back-scratching.
When most countries recoiled in horror at China's killing of unarmed protesters four months ago, East Berlin helped break China's isolation by offering support and congratulations.
Likewise, when China had trouble getting guests for its national day celebrations on 1 October, the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, East Germany was again glad to oblige, along with hardline stalwarts such as <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> Cuba </location></annot>, North Korea, Czechoslovakia and three African countries: the Comoros, Kenya and Burundi.
In its zeal to relieve China's embarrassment at hosting a party with so few guests, East Berlin sent two senior officials &mdash; Egon Krenz, a member of the Politburo, and Wolfgang Rachfuss, a member of the Central Committee.

Every morning we woke to find ourselves surrounded by fresh tracks made by capybaras (the world's largest species of rodent, looking something like a giant guinea pig); on our last evening, the boatman killed an alligator as it crawled past our camp-fire to go hunting in the reeds beyond.

Barbados, which even now has little more than a quarter of a million people, has led the way with a roll of honour of mind-boggling proportions.

The post-1940s policy consensus in Britain, argues Hall, involved the trade unions and management, as well as the central government.
Consensus was of a rather passive kind and policy tended to rely on very general financial guidelines operated by the Bank of England and the Treasury; financial aid to industry was confined to regional development aid.
In <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot>, by contrast, post-1940s reconstruction was marked by extensive nationalization accompanied by state planning.
The national policy consensus excluded the trade unions; the alliance of government agencies and certain companies was more activist than in Britain; planning goals were pursued with a battery of penalty and incentive powers.

The reports of the great Parliamentary Commissions, which in the 1830s and 1840s investigated working conditions in factories and mines, were saturated with an obsessive concern with the sexuality of the working class, the social other, displacing in the end the acute social crisis from the area of exploitation and class conflict, where it could not be coped with, into the framework of a more amenable and discussable area of &bquo; morality &equo;.

The controversy over the Contagious Diseases Acts, passed in the 1860s to impose compulsory medical examination and registration on working-class women suspected of being prostitutes in designated garrison and naval towns, generated an avalanche of controversy and publications.

During the transitional period the Latvian Supreme Soviet would remain the &quot; supreme power &quot; in the republic, and the provisions of the 1978 Constitution of Soviet Latvia would remain in force provided that the four key articles from the 1922 Constitution were not contradicted.

There will be a demand for more second homes in the countryside, and some families may reverse the process altogether by moving to the country and keeping a town pad for use while at work.
In other scenarios, almost everyone could move to low-density countryside houses and communicate via the electronic technology that is already available, or alternatively people could recolonize the countryside and run smallholdings (Anderson, 1975).
If these forecasts are correct, and they of course ignore the inertia of the system, and the immense social capital invested in cities, then the population and employment changes revealed by this chapter are only the precursors of a massive recolonization of the countryside, not only in the UK but also the <annot><location reading="literal"> USA </location></annot> (Fisher and Mitchelson, 1981).

While there was certainly an increase in the output of these businesses in the prosperous years of the late 1970s it is doubtful if they did more than keep pace with the fast growth rate for the manufacturing sector as a whole, estimated by the World Bank to be 12 per cent from 1970 to 1982.

Though arrested in <annot><location reading="literal"> Denmark </location></annot>, Britain, France and Spain for narcotics and arms offences, al-Kassar had made himself too valuable an asset to European and American intelligence agencies for them to allow him to go to waste in prison, so that he went about his illegal business with a brazen assurance matched only among international criminals by his partner, Rifat Assad, younger brother of the Syrian president, who also owned a villa outside Marbella, and whose daughter, Raja, was al-Kassar's mistress.
After an unsuccessful attempt to depose his brother Hafez Assad from the presidency in 1984, Rifat had been banished to Paris, a punishment akin to being kicked out of purgatory and forced to live in paradise.

For both Poland and Germany, Danzig became an isolated node of half-realised ambitions, of pointless and wasteful economic competition, of half-understood fears, of provincial prejudice and wilful stiff-necked pride.
These elements were part of a long and complex history of German restlessness and Polish insecurity &mdash; ideas that the British, French and Americans, secure in thoroughly different kinds of national, linguistic and cultural identities, could not even begin to chart.
The Allies' aim in 1918 had been to leave <annot><location reading="literal"> Germany </location></annot> shorn of its military and industrial power, to make sure that it would never again be capable of waging war or threatening the established pattern of Atlantic trade and European industry.

The range of the diary is extremely limited: Kilvert was not widely read, and he was uninterested in politics and ideas in general.
The public events of his time leave little mark; and, apart from occasional visits to London and Oxford and an account of a holiday in Cornwall, which is one of the diary's tours de force, his record hardly strays outside the very narrow circumferences of rural Radnorshire and rural Wiltshire.
(Kilvert paid at least two visits to <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot> and Switzerland, but neither of these is covered by the diary: in 1878 he was also offered the English chaplaincy at Cannes, but refused it.)
It is also true that Kilvert had no gift for self-analysis, and further that the diary was impoverished by his widow's removal from it of the volumes which apparently described not only their courtship and marriage, but the two most profound of Kilvert's previous affairs of the heart; though she left the frequent passages describing Kilvert's passionate attachments to young girls, whose fundamentally erotic nature it is clear that neither she nor Kilvert himself recognized.

Their philosophical idealism was at once a retreat from the material world of unruly mobs and declining privilege and a programme for maintaining their position while accommodating some change: &bquo; Socratic political thought was an intellectually sophisticated and ingenious justification for counter-revolution in democracy and the maintenance of the status quo in oligarchy &equo; (ibid. p. 4).
One can recognise easily why so many later European commentators extolled classical Greece as the model for their contemporaries since the material conditions of these changes from rural to urban, from aristocracy to bourgeoisie, and from oligarchy to proto&rehy;democracy similarly characterised their own social situation.
As Wood and Wood argue, the sympathy of the classicists for the social class represented by the Socratics of classical <annot><location reading="literal"> Greece </location></annot> made them &bquo; more than ready to accept rather uncritically their account of the situation in Athens and throughout the Greek world &equo;.

The reaction to Richardson can be attributed to three factors &mdash; a rumour that supposed friction between him and Jamaica's Jeffrey Dujon led to Dujon's omission from the World Cup; another rumour that Richardson passed some remark about Jamaicans after the Dujon affair; and that Richardson described the historic World Cup encounter with <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="ORG"> South Africa </location></annot> as &bquo; just another cricket match &equo;.

The final hurdle was overcome on Dec. 18, when the Ministers approved a directive on the question of solvency and capital adequacy for banks-an issue which had already caused deep disagreement, notably in West Germany, where fears had been expressed that it would lead to a dilution of the sector's relatively high national standards.
The main disagreements had centred on the question as to whether banking and securities firms should be allowed to include risk investments (ie shares in other companies), rather than merely cash deposits, when they were declaring the capital on which their financial integrity was assessed for authorization purposes.
Whereas this practice was widespread in the UK, it was banned in most other EC member states; UK observers noted that its abolition in the UK would force <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot> institutions to double their cash holdings, a factor which they said would raise costs and which could thus jeopardize the dominant position of the London market in European equity trading (see also p. 36494).

Around four million barrels (660,000 tonnes) of oil were being burned each day in March 1991, nearly three times the pre-war Kuwait output and almost 10 per cent of the world's daily ration.

Nevertheless Poland was still encumbered by a poorly developed industrial sector, a primitive, almost feudal, agricultural system, an under-funded banking sector and a poorly integrated railway system, and was hampered by the fact that it paid out 40 per cent of Gross National Income (approximately 28 per cent of all government expenditure) to maintain an army that was second in size only to that of Russia.

They had no choice; their economy had very little room for manoeuvre, the German threat meant heavy military investment at the cost of social and industrial improvement; yet any halt in the country's ability to trade was tied directly to the continued life of the government, the existence of the state and the possibility of a military solution to all its problems.

Only then did Parliament proceed to the enactment of the legislation which, in the eyes of British (although not Irish) constitutional law, established the Irish Free State (the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, incorporating the December agreement into United Kingdom law, the Irish Free State (Constitution) Act and the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, all 1922), and preserved the union in relation to Northern Ireland.

Methods of calculation of such denudation rates have been greatly refined by Walling (e.g. Walling and Webb, 1983) who has also reviewed the ways in which hydrological systems are modified by man, and results from catchment experiments have documented the effects of land clearance, land drainage, recreational pressure, strip mining, conservation measures and urbanization (Walling, 1979).

According to the Thera-vada school of Buddhism, the Southern Buddhism of Burma, <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="POP"> Ceylon </location></annot>, Siam and Cambodia, there is no grace from outside man's being to support, strengthen and save him; he must rely on his own efforts, and the task will need more lives than one, countless lives in this world, alternating perhaps with lives in a heaven or hell.
Buddhists of the Northern school of China and Japan evolved their own theory of grace and came to believe in the Buddha as a Saviour, though in the earliest Scriptures he himself claimed to be nothing more than a teacher, a shower of the way.

The iconography of a state's coinage viewed over a period of time can reveal a certain amount of information about the aspirations of that state, since the choice of designs will normally reflect the matters considered important by at least an influential body in that state and will present these important matters in a particular way.
In the modern world, for instance, one might look at the development of the personification of Britannia as an index of the growing imperialism of Britain (fig. 20).
We are, of course, familiar with a heavily armed Britannia brandishing a trident and ruling the waves, but her development in this way is simply an indication of <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people"> Britain </location></annot>'s preoccupation with military conquest since the seventeenth century.

Culturally, the native population encountered by the Russians was more varied than that found by the first Europeans in northern North America, but the general linguistic situation in the two regions was similar.
This fact is generally obscured by the appearance of simplicity and tidiness imposed by the classification of the existing languages of the USSR, since, out of its approximately 105 recognized native languages, only about twenty-nine, belonging to eleven families, are indigenous to Siberia.
This appears to offer a contrast with the 200 native languages (in fifty-seven families) in present-day <annot><location reading="literal"> North America </location></annot>, of which about sixty-eight occur north of the 45th parallel (the zone comparable with Siberia).
In fact the situation in sixteenth-century Siberia was rather different from what it is today, since a considerable number of languages, such as Kott, Yug, Arin, Assan, Pumpokol, Kamas and Mator, have died out completely.

Alternatively, the heating of the smoke plume due to its absorption of solar energy may have been more important than the reduced surface heating such that a net warming of the lower atmosphere produced a slight enhancement of the Asian summer monsoon overall (Browning et al., 1991) or over specific areas such as the Tibetan plateau (Bakan et al., 1991).
Generally, it is agreed that whatever the magnitude of the effects of the soot plumes on the monsoon, it will have been within the range of natural interannual variability and very difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate.

There was usually a good deal of flexibility in the organisation of these political departments: their number and scope altered easily and often to meet changing demands.
The British foreign office, for example, had in 1835&mdash;41 a short-lived China department, the result of the ending in 1833 of the East India Company's monopoly of trade with China and of the growing tensions which erupted in the &quot; Opium War &quot; of 1839&mdash;42.
By the 1880s it had three main departments of this kind: Eastern, Western and American (the last also covering China, <annot><location reading="literal"> Japan </location></annot> and Siam).
By 1900, however, a Far Eastern department had been created and most of the business relating to African questions had been given to a new African department: in other words the administrative subdivisions were adapted to the changing political importance of different parts of the world.

Thus even these reduced targets were not met: actual commissioning levels were 37 per cent below target in 1949, 19 per cent below in 1950 and 42 per cent below in 1951, with the programmed stations for these years being rolled over into 1952 and 1953.
This shortfall arose partly because, even when difficulties could be foreseen, it was sensible to aim high and maintain manufacturers' confidence in a sustained market growth, though, as we shall see, it also reflects a persistently poor record for the British power station construction industry on completion times.
Power cuts were thus to remain a fact of life at winter peak times in <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot> into the early 1950s.
Although the widespread disruption of the earlier 1949 crisis was avoided, the load which had to be shed in the severe winter of 1951 (2109MW) was in absolute terms the highest ever, and still amounted to 17 per cent of the load on the system.

As well as a detailed examination of national and foreign published material, the project will gather new information through a series of in-depth interviews with Government policy makers concerned with debt renegotiation strategies and their broader political and social consequences, the chief business organisations in each country, politicians, policy-makers, Church representatives, trade union and community leaders &mdash; paying particular attention to the inter-relationship of economic and socio-political issues.

Rugby Union: New rules make scouting a positive option for clubs

Whether Evans, now 54, and who has suffered serious heart problems, is of an age and whether he has the constitution to undertake such a demanding task is another matter.

But when Dr Dee (a scientist too aware of his Welsh descent to want to use the word &bquo; English &equo;) wrote about the British Empire in the 1570s he was discussing the prospect of possessions beyond the seas, which were likely to be linked to England by the bond of allegiance to the sovereign more than by anything else.
There were limits to the range of territory that could be held together in this way in the sixteenth century: towards the end of his life Charles V abdicated and retired to a monastery, leaving his German lands and his title of Holy Roman Emperor to the line of his brother Ferdinand, even though he would probably have preferred to keep the entire empire together and leave it to his son Philip.

We should also have to do without Rome, la Grece et les monarchies hellenistiques by Maurice Holleaux (Paris, 1921), who spent so much intelligence and acumen in trying to make sense of Polybius through the hypothesis that Rome blundered into empire by overrating the aggressive intentions of the Hellenistic states.

Many of the earliest public libraries were busily involved in adult education, providing lectures and discussion meetings, arranging exhibitions and displays, and going out with some of their stock to societies and schools and clubs in the most admirably proselytizing manner; many actually had art galleries and museums under their care as well, providing an early example of multi-media provision.
Children's librarians have notoriously never sat still in their back rooms (or anywhere) but provide regular story-hours, give introductory talks to classes brought in from local schools, and get to know their young clientele very thoroughly indeed.
In our rural areas, libraries have taken their stock out to the people in bookmobiles and (to the astonishment of visiting Americans) made available from these peripatetic points full access to the national interlending system of which <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people"> Britain </location></annot> is justifiably rather proud.

That Yuri Andropov was head of the KGB, or even the <annot><location reading="literal"> USSR </location></annot>'s Ambassador in Hungary in 1956, may tell us little of how he might want to behave as the Tsar, and First Secretary of the Communist Party.

The southern States had the lowest effective tax rates (for local and State corporate and property taxes) in the 1970s, for example, and many local governments there have fewer controls on development (Houston's lack of a land-use plan is frequently cited in this respect).
Further, the growth of Federal expenditure, in support for agriculture and in the expansion of the aerospace and defence industries (see above) have all favoured the South.
The outcome of all this, Peet contends, is a clear &bquo; geography of class struggle &equo; (figure 5.16) in the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot> in the 1970s, in which the southern States (with the exception of Louisiana and, to a lesser extent, Alabama) have the lowest values (i.e. the least conflict), along with the Dakotas.

Nationalities policy was perhaps the biggest single failure of perestroika.
Part of the problem, certainly, was the slow and inadequate response of the central authorities and of Gorbachev personally to a deepening crisis.
Looking back, Gorbachev was prepared to acknowledge &bquo; mistakes in tactics &equo;; but although he travelled more widely throughout the country than previous Soviet leaders, he was also guilty of some remarkably insensitive mistakes (as when he twice referred to the Soviet Union as &bquo; Russia &equo; during a visit to the <annot><location reading="literal"> Ukraine </location></annot>).
The failure of Soviet nationalities policy, however, was more than a personal failure; it also reflected the failure, over more than seventy years, to devise an official theory that could adequately account for ethnic and national differences, and perhaps a still deeper weakness in a doctrine that insisted working men &bquo; had no country &equo;.

The Brunei government on Jan. 6 ordered the release of six political prisoners who had been detained soon after the large-scale revolt which broke out in Brunei and other parts of British Borneo in 1962 &lsqb; see p. 19261; for release of 38 political detainees in 1988 see p. 36355 &rsqb;.
The Times of Jan. 10 reported that the <annot><location reading="literal"> United Kingdom </location></annot> government had pressed for the release of the six after being informed of their plight by Roland (&quot; Tiny &quot;) Rowland, the chief executive of the Lonrho group of companies.
A small number of political prisoners remained in detention in Brunei, including the two leaders of the banned Brunei National Democratic Party arrested in early 1988 &lsqb; see p. 36355 &rsqb;.

The fires, which are concentrated on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, have been blamed on a combination of four months of low rainfall and the after-effects of widespread logging, which have left large swathes of comparatively parched land on which fires can take hold easily and spread to secondary forest growth.
This is drier than the original primary growth and hence more susceptible to fire.
<annot><location reading="literal"> Indonesia </location></annot>'s dwindling reserves of virgin rainforest appear to be largely unaffected.

Overall, the money markets saw an ebbing of confidence in the United States dollar and a slight improvement in prospects for the German mark, while sterling ended the year close to where it had started.
The fair performance of the German currency appeared to discount the difficulties which many traders envisaged in the wake of German unification and, more specifically, of the controversial decision to unite the East and West German marks at par value, a move which was to weaken confidence in the mark in early 1991.
Central bankers were also concerned in the spring of 1991 that the German government might attempt to stave off the pressure on the mark by raising interest rates, a move which they felt would further depress the prospects for world economic growth; by April, however, it appeared that global interest rates were at last starting to come down, with particularly strong declines in the United Kingdom, the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot> and France.

Tory business managers began to scurry around anxiously and Sir Nicholas Lyell was clearly taken by surprise and began scribbling notes to form the basis of his speech.
Last week Douglas Hurd made a U-turn over the Maastricht bill when he apologised to the Commons for inaccurate legal advice given previously by Mr Garel-Jones about the status of the social chapter amendment.

The milk is notable for a high protein content (3.49 per cent) and this is a factor which is increasingly important in milk production the world over.
The breed is particularly useful for increasing milk production in beef breeds or improving beef production in dairy herds, and is well suited to single or multiple suckling.

Beyond the agricultural connection, the main economic strength of a community resided in the number and variety of craftsmen which it could support.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that the range of economic services carried out at individual small towns is never easy to define.

We must therefore depend almost exclusively on the archaeological record, even though the survival of crucial evidence for the range of shops and their resident craftsmen is frequently highly selective and difficult to interpret in the context of market-places and external economic contacts.

One possible explanation for governments' concern about inflation is that they are fearful that a rising rate may get out of control and develop into a &bquo; runaway &equo; inflation or hyperinflation.

There was (as indeed there still is) a strange belief that the German language showed a particular affinity with Greek and was, among other things, uniquely placed to achieve effects associated with the ancient system of quantitative metre.This theory, already prefigured by Klopstock, was worked out at inordinate length by the poet, scholar and translator Johann Heinrich Voss (1751&ndash;1816) and, erroneous though it was, it served to fuel the growing fire of Hellenism by Stimulating the imitation of Greek metres in German poetry.
There were those, again, in Germany as elsewhere, for whom the terms &quot; Hellas &quot; and &quot; liberty &quot; were axiomatically linked: a link symptomatized and strengthened by the warm interest taken by many German writers in the Greek struggle for independence, whose fruition followed in the wake of the French Revolution.
One of these writers, the poet H&ouml;lderlin, claims our particular attention here for the new attitude towards Germany that his commitment to the Greek ideal entails &mdash; and also for his intuitive awareness of a greater complexity underlying &quot; the spirit of <annot><location reading="literal"> Greece </location></annot> &quot; than Winckelmann or his immediate successors had been able to recognize.

Anti-avoidance provisions
The COB Rules contain some sophisticated anti-avoidance provisions, which are intended to prevent firms from routing business offshore in order to take advantage of the foreign business carve-out.
As a result of these anti-avoidance provisions, the foreign business carve-out is excluded, and the general COB Rules apply in relation to the customer concerned, where: (1) A UK office executes a transaction with or for a <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot> private customer on the instructions of a non-UK office; or (2) A UK office gives investment advice in relation to any transaction to a non-UK office, which the non-UK office passes on to (or uses for the benefit of) a UK private customer if (in either case): (a) the UK office itself transmitted the order to a non-UK office of the firm (even if a different one from that instructing it); (b) the UK office has itself advised the customer in relation to the transaction concerned (and the customer has then directly or indirectly given the order to the non-UK office which deals through the UK office); or (c) the UK office has advised the customer to deal through or seek advice from a non-UK office of the firm (even if the relevant prescribed disclosure was made).
In these anti-avoidance provisions, the relevant test for a &quot; UK customer &quot; is that he is normally resident in the UK and they can therefore apply even if he is physically outside the UK at the relevant time (eg at the non-UK office concerned).

And of course they will suffer consequences &mdash; at the very least those of wasted time and lost opportunities.

The ideological approach to the problem of soil erosion in the international aid and academic communities can not be &bquo; read off &equo; or predetermined by the relative strength of direct economic interests, as there is often a degree of autonomy of these ideas from economic determinants.
After all, the national interests of donors and the multilateral agencies they finance would be much better served by other projects than soil conservation which is a difficult, diffuse and problematic area for foreign aid with goals that are very long term and difficult to achieve.

Shorn of all element of compulsion, now that the United States was no longer even pretending that the dollar was convertible into gold, the rise in official holdings of dollars showed that dollars were the best asset to hold.
The United States was reaping the benefit of its industrial and financial might without having to resort to any crude use of political power.
When the issue of international monetary reform had been seriously debated in 1972 the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> United States </location></annot> started from the position that &bquo; the system should neither bar nor encourage official holdings of foreign exchange &equo;, suggesting that &bquo; the United States still thought of the SDR as providing a substitute for gold rather than for the dollar &equo; (Williamson, 1977, p. 176).
Although the United States accepted the case for the dollar eventually being convertible into SDRs, in its view this had to result from the dollar being sufficiently competitive to generate enough capital and current account surpluses over a period to make convertibility a reality.

Drastic action from Lamont becomes advisable
THE last thing Norman Lamont and John Major wanted on a day when the unadjusted unemployment total topped 3 million again in spite of all the Government's (indirect) efforts to set the scene for recovery was for the IMF to meddle in <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> UK </location></annot> economic policy issues.
But there seems little doubt that the IMF, which monitors the economies of all member countries behind the scenes, has suggested the Chancellor's Budget next month should cut the public sector's borrowing requirements in the next financial year, either by increasing taxes or by cutting public spending.

The fundamental problem faced by US business was that rivals in Europe and Japan were accumulating capital at a far faster rate (figure 10.4) and were doing so on the basis of far lower wage costs (table 10.5).
Between 1955 and 1970 the capital stock in US manufacturing rose by 74 per cent; in the major European countries the rise was 115 per cent, and in Japan it was some 500 per cent.
Taking into account the rise in employment, the rise in capital stock per head (an index of increased mechanization) was 51 per cent in the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot>, 90 per cent in Europe, and 202 per cent in Japan (figure 10.5).
New investment per employed worker in US manufacturing in 1955 was running at about 1.6 times the European level, and nearly five times that of Japan; by 1970 US manufacturing was investing about the same per worker as European industry and one-third less than Japanese.

The royal couple used the opportunity to seek an improvement in relations and particularly to address the problem of Japanese atrocities during the occupation of the region in the 1930s and 1940s.
At the start of his first visit &mdash; to Thailand on Sept. 26-30 &mdash; the Emperor told King Bhumibol Adulyadej that Japan had &quot; resolved that it would live as a nation of peace, so that it should never repeat the horrors of that most unfortunate war &quot;, and that Japan had made &quot; unremitting efforts &quot; to build &quot; new friendships &quot; in the region.
In Malaysia, where anti-Japanese sentiment was known to be stronger, the Emperor had a short meeting on Sept. 30 with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, and another with Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, the reigning monarch, who asked <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> Japan </location></annot> to take the lead in forming a new economic community of East Asian countries.

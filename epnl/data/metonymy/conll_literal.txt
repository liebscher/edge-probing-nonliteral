Chechnya<SEP>Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war, Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement, somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow's insistence that <ENT>Chechnya<ENT> remain part of Russia, will be no easy matter.
Russia<SEP>Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war, Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement, somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow's insistence that Chechnya remain part of <ENT>Russia<ENT>, will be no easy matter.
Grozny<SEP>A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier's knack for making life sound simple, Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week, days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital <ENT>Grozny<ENT>.
Moscow<SEP>Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in <ENT>Moscow<ENT> -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday.
Chechnya<SEP>Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in <ENT>Chechnya<ENT> as Yeltsin, hardly seen since his reelection last month, kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce.
Moscow<SEP>If that were the case, it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in <ENT>Moscow<ENT>.
Moscow<SEP>Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in <ENT>Moscow<ENT>, who have profited from the war and want it to go on, would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him.
North Caucasus<SEP>Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions, particularly in the strategic <ENT>North Caucasus<ENT>.

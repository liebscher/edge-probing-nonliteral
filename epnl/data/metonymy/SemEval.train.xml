The US Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a new staff report on the anti-trust allegations against Microsoft Corp, but a decision on the matter probably is still weeks away, lawyers familiar with the case told the Wall Street Journal: with a two-to-two vote in February, the commission didn't accept staff recommendations to seek an injunction preventing the company from using its market power to engage in allegedly unfair competitive practices; after the tied vote, the commissioners asked for more information in an effort to resolve the deadlock; the status report, which was delivered to commissioners last week, provides additional support for the staff's call for action.

The influx of cheap Arab labour from the occupied territories allowed the Israeli economy to expand rapidly after 1967, pushing unskilled Jewish labour into higher grade work. 
The shift in the labour pattern significantly reduced the tensions between the European and non-European and largely unskilled Jewish elements in Israel which during the 1960s was becoming a serious social and political issue since the latter grew faster demographically than the former. 
Overall, <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="underspecified between OFF, POP"> Israel </location></annot>'s absorption of over 100,000 Palestinians as casual labourers created a feeling of weakness and helplessness in the Palestinian community, and of success and power within the Israeli economy. 
Since the territories were captive, Israel could develop them as its second largest export market (after the United States), with an export value of &dollar;800 million annually by 1986.

Why don't we do it? &equo; and we all agreed rather tentatively that it might be a good idea. 
Well, unlike many of the promises that are made over the clinking of glasses and in the glow of a few drinks, and despite the fact that Pam and Tony lived near Thurso in the north of Scotland, Wendy was working in Bristol and I lived in Shetland, we got in touch later and laid firm plans for a trip to Lapland.

Thus the Long Gilt suffered a mild setback in 1988 and 1989 as the public sector finances moved from deficit to surplus and the Treasury instituted a &quot; buy-back &quot; programme for long-dated gilts. 
Partly due to this, the long end of the yield curve has been rather stable in the UK, and the need to hedge at this end of the term structure was diminished. 
However, turnover increased in 1990 due to <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot> entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which implied a shift in longer term inflationary expectations and a fortiori long rates of interest, combined with the fact that the public sector finances had moved back into deficit. 
The German Bund contract was strong from the outset, probably due to the previously unsatisfied demand for derivatives based on German bonds, but this has been strengthened considerably by the reunification of Germany and the resulting uncertainty about long term yields on German paper.

Some of the books which he is known to have possessed, which included Christine de Pisan's Letter of Othea to Hector, a didactic work for knights, reinforce this view. 
At the same time Fastolf s attitude to the practicalities of war reflect a hardheadedness which was essentially of this world: the plan which he drew up in 1435 favouring a &bquo; tough &equo; approach to the war made little concession to romantic ideas of chivalry which would influence a knight's conduct in war. 
His long career in <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot> which led him to hold high military and administrative posts, as well as amassing a fortune through the capture of prisoners in battle, the seizing of property and the exploitation of estates, shows him to have been a &bquo; realistic &equo; person in all that he did.

It was alleged by Clasper that the foreman had his knife in the young kid who was only doing his job.

Clasper and the conspirators timed the third offence to coincide with the visit to the <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot> of the President and Chief Executive Officer of United Motors, Nate Cocello, as this would provide maximum publicity to the planned strike. 
An attempt would then be made to drag Cocello into the dispute by Clasper making a public appeal to the President to reinstate the sacked shop steward over the heads of plant and divisional management.

The xenophobia and repression associated with Stalin's last years and the culmination of the personality cult belied the Soviet Union's internationalist pretensions. 
Even those who saw the extension of Moscow's control over her eastern European neighbours as primarily a response to American expansion objected to the oppressive form of Soviet rule. 
The successive rebellions against Soviet-backed regimes &mdash; in <annot><location reading="literal"> East Germany </location></annot> in 1953, in Poland and Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Poland in the early 1980s &mdash; progressively undermined the allegiance of foreign radicals to the USSR. 
This bristling empire built on the bones of peasants and political prisoners and denying the most fundamental rights to the workers themselves seemed more and more a mere mirror image of the capitalist system rejected by western radicals.

He had based his electoral platform on the need for better relations with the United States. 
Political observers felt, however, that difficulties could still arise with the USA, because of his publicly expressed view that Japan's trade surplus was a &quot; fundamentally insoluble problem &quot; caused by unstoppable world demand for superior Japanese products, and would remain impervious to import tariffs or even major currency shifts. 
Miyazawa's recent calls for a period of renewed economic growth in <annot><location reading="literal"> Japan </location></annot> and for a cut in Japanese interest rates (implying a weakening of the yen and a growth in the trade surplus) were also received with concern in the USA. 
Miyazawa had also called during his election campaign for the political rehabilitation and &quot; purification &quot; of Japanese politicians who had been implicated, like himself, in the financial scandals of recent years.

The Kabul regime responded by reinforcing the garrison's 3,000-4,000 regular troops and by launching a high-altitude bombing campaign; Kabul-based Scud-missiles were also fired at rebel positions. 
An assortment of mujaheddin guerrillas were involved in the offensive, including supporters of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's fundamentalist Hezb-e Islami and Jalaluddin Haqqani's rival Hezb-e Islami (Yunis Khan faction). 
The rebels also reportedly received logistical support from the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and its Pakistani counterpart, the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).

In addition, the very high demand in the early seventies may well have pushed up investment goods prices especially fast.

Finally, some part of the fall in the output-capital ratio in the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot> after 1966 must have reflected the decreasing capacity utilization.

Such a commitment to the environment is, none the less, both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing, let alone forthcoming, environmental problems.

In future, gene transfer could greatly increase the possibilities for improved crop performance, not simply by increasing yield, but also by modifying other characteristics. 
One example is the research into the proteins in the wheat grain on which bread baking quality largely depends, particularly the gluten fraction responsible for the elasticity of the dough. 
Gluten is deficient in many high yielding varieties of wheat used in Britain, local flour being fortified by the addition of high gluten varieties imported from <annot><location reading="literal"> North America </location></annot>. 
If suitable genes for gluten production could be added to British varieties, or if the genes in British wheat were made to produce more or better gluten, imports would be saved and farmers would get a higher price for a better quality wheat.

<bnc:title> Restructuring Britain: the economy in question </bnc:title>
<par>
This definition of deindustrialization is concerned with the ability of the economy to produce a socially acceptable level of employment (full employment) in a context where the unemployment level is itself a product of government regulations about definitions and individuals' propensity to register. 
Secondly, given this definition, why in so much discussion of deindustrialization is the emphasis placed on manufacturing? 
In considering this question, Rhodes relates it specifically to the case of the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-event" notes="situation"> UK </location></annot>: &bquo; prominence is given to manufacturing only because Britain, as most other advanced countries, has relied heavily on manufacturing activities as a source of net exports and employment &equo; (1986, p. 139). 
This raises the question whether, if manufacturing industry is collapsing, that implies the collapse of the UK economy.

The economic and social instability of Eastern Europe seems likely to be a major political factor over the medium-term future, but it is far from being the only element of instability in the present world system. 
Thus, nationalism has re-emerged also in Western Europe, in neo-fascist and populist forms, directed frequently against immigrants and potential immigrants (and immigration itself is in part a consequence of the extreme poverty of some Third World countries, and of the economic decline of Eastern Europe). 
Uncontrolled population growth, the continuing deterioration of the environment, the economic depression in the major capitalist countries, the shift of economic power from the US to Japan and the European Community (and particularly to <annot><location reading="literal"> Germany </location></annot>) and the growing tensions between these three centres, the increasing disparity of wealth between the poorer developing countries and the industrial nations, are all potent sources of social dislocation and instability. 
Far from having reached the sunny uplands of history, as some have claimed, therefore, human beings will perhaps have to face, even in the present generation, new trials on a bleak and inhospitable mountainside.

Undoubtedly there have been numerous policy turnabouts, most noticeably at the time of the Cultural Revolution when forestry resources were misused for unsuitable land reclamation (Gustafsson, undated), which in certain particularly vulnerable areas may have exacerbated the destructive floods of autumn 1981. 
But the combination of the daunting task of national reconstruction after the Communist victory in 1949, the neglect of conservation for centuries, and a variety of purely physical factors making for great erosion hazards, must also be taken into account. 
Thus, as in the case of the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-event" notes="situation"> USA </location></annot>, the size and complexity of the programmes, mixed successes, and the possibility that programmes have significantly reduced soil losses, or even the rate of decline rather than improved yields, point to the need for a longer and more sophisticated assessment than is given here.

Under the terms of the 1980 Constitution legislative power is vested in a 496-member National Assembly (Quoc Hoi) elected for a five-year term, which elects a Council of State (the collective presidency) and a Council of Ministers headed by a Chair.

The characteristic feature of power elite rule in liberal democracies is its selectiveness. 
While many run-of-the-mill domestic issues may be left open for policy debate and political influence to decide, in every liberal democratic country the core executive monopolizes major issues such as defence and foreign policy resolution, or critical economic decisions (the dark or secret side of the state). 
For example, in <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot> successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers from 1948 though to 1979 developed the British nuclear deterrent in virtually complete secrecy, with no parliamentary or media discussion until decisions were accomplished facts, and even without disclosing decisions made to most of their fellow Cabinet ministers (Freedman, 1980). 
Some democratic elite theorists have argued that a much wider group of elected political leaders play political or policy direction roles than the power elite conception implies.

Discussions on the Treaty of Rome had entered their final stages, with ratification outstanding only from France and West Germany. 
It was not surprising, therefore, that while the Six were willing to discuss the Grand Design within the OEEC context, they saw it as an addition to, not a replacement for, their own plans. 
<annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> Britain </location></annot>'s strategy was not just to block the Six, but to have something in place should they succeed in getting their common market off the ground. 
To counteract the possibility of discrimination by the EEC should it be able to establish a common external tariff, the other OEEC states would need to accept a lowering of or even an end to their tariffs, providing the Six would waive their common external tariff on goods coming from the rest of the OEEC.

Many in the industry felt it was worth while taking risks on the peak space heating load, by keeping prices sufficiently low to attract in addition such off-peak evening or spring and autumn space heating loads, as well as the cooking and water heating sales. 
Others (who were more justly accused of commercial megalomania or electrical messianism by critics) felt that the &bquo; all-electric &equo; future was near at hand, and that it was only a matter of time before all heating &mdash; continuous or intermittent &mdash; would be by electricity. 
The crux of the debate was whether this was the most cost-effective way of meeting the demand for heating in <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot>, 7 and the Boards were under considerable pressure from the Government to justify their commercial policy, which seemed to be attracting peak loads at uneconomic prices. 
We have seen the deep resentment of the chairmen at Gaitskell's imposition of the Clow differential, which was an attempt to create a pricing structure which reflected the higher winter peak costs (pp. 36&ndash;8, above).

The failure of the Prussian and German people to follow the successful example of the French in a revolution from below meant that in 1870 they were forced to accept the unification of Germany by the reactionary Junker powers.

The unification of <annot><location reading="literal"> Germany </location></annot> protected the lifestyle of the Prussian Junkers &mdash; indeed, the Junkers' need to protect themselves and their lifestyle from the disrupting effects of outside economic competition through the creation and extension of a tariff union had been one of the major components in the formation of the German state.

Life, after all, is funny. 
Soap, whether radio or TV, suggests a similar national contrast. 
Mrs Dale's Diary, which ran for twenty-one years on BBC radio from 1948, was always gently laced with humour; its rural rival, The Archers, which began two years later, is a broadly similar amalgam of the playful and the sentimental; and between them, in a sub-literary sort of way, they illustrate the power of a revived realism in post-war <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot>: quite different from the grand-opera histrionics of American TV soaps like Dallas or Dynasty, which are scarcely funny at all, at least in intention, and wildly unrealistic as images of how the rich in the United States really live.

As a result, by the time war was declared in 1939 MI6 had failed to establish any worthwhile network of agents in Europe and those it had were of very dubious quality, some even dishonest and fraudulent. 
MI6 never appreciated the amount of opposition that existed within Germany to Hitler and the Nazi party in its early days and as a result failed to exploit the very considerable amount of information that was offered to it by well-placed anti-Nazi groups. 
In 1939 MI6 received the famous Oslo Report, a package of technical information delivered to the British Legation in Oslo, containing a wealth of priceless data about secret weapon developments in <annot><location reading="literal"> Germany </location></annot> including rocket design at a then unheard of location called Peenem&uuml;nde. 
Because MI6 possessed no one with any technical qualifications to analyse the Oslo Report it was rejected as worthless and ignored.

Certainly no generalisation can be made except that the successful diffusion of the knowledge of soil conserving practices is often one essential change that is required &mdash; even although the knowledge may be possessed by some cultivators already. 
Usually, as this book will argue, successful agricultural extension is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for implanting sound conservation practices (see Thrupp (1981) for a case study of the (jaded) peasant view of conservation in Costa Rica). 
Solutions to population pressure, differentiation, and declining productivity through soil exhaustion and erosion, which lie outside the agricultural sector altogether, do not offer the same promise as they did in Japan, the <annot><location reading="literal"> USA </location></annot> or the United Kingdom during their industrial revolutions. 
Outmigration to cities in search of menial jobs or part-time work in nearby plantations provide remittances and reduce food demand, but these activities also reduce labour availability and have been responsible for the collapse of old-established terracing systems in the Middle and near East, particularly Yemen and also in the Andean part of Peru and Colombia.

From one analysis of data for 25 developing countries, it was determined that, if all children were born at least two years apart, about one in five infant deaths would be averted. 
According to another report that was based upon essentially the same data, the spacing of second and higher order births at least two years apart would reduce infant mortality by 10 per cent and the death rate of children aged 1&ndash;4 years by 21 per cent. 
In traditional societies where prolonged breastfeeding has been the custom, the advantages of lengthy spacing are widely recognized though, as in <annot><location reading="literal"> Kenya </location></annot>, the tradition has begun to fade among some peoples along with the advance of modernization. 
Because the ability of breastfeeding to sustain the period of infecundity due to amenorrhoea over long periods depends, inter alia, upon the frequency and intensity of suckling, and in the light of the generalized view that lengthy spacing is essential to child survival, in most African and some other societies, breastfeeding is reinforced by abstinence.

But the significant point is that it underlines the United States' determination to prevent the persistent undervaluation of the mark or the yen. 
Such a concern is explained by the fact that these countries had repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to go to enormous lengths (in effect taxing imports of capital, encouraging exports of capital and, even in the case of Japan, organizing plans for importing huge stockpiles of raw materials) in order to prevent an upward movement of their currencies.

Still, it is sometimes possible to infer alterations over time, and one direct conclusion that can be drawn is that part, at least, of landlords' rationale was economic: within a situation affected by such non-economic factors as pious donations, landlords organised estates and renders to maximise resources. 
This was a function of the domanial estate-structure (sometimes known to English-speaking historians as the manorial system), that is of a central directly-farmed agricultural unit, having peasant-tenements grouped around it and owing labour-services on it, and more distant tenements associated with it owing other types of dues and services. 
This domanial regime suited large-scale landlords with far-flung holdings (great monasteries were landlords of this type), and by Charles the Bald's reign, it had become general in much of what is now <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot> north of the Loire with some examples also further south in Poitou.

It was to be hoped that capitalist progress would eventually bring the labourers nearer to this maximum, and regrettable (though not inconvenient for keeping wages down) that so many were still so far below it.

Underwood's recent retirement from the international scene as England's most capped player highlights the distinguished contribution made to English rugby, both on and off the field, by the RAF. 
It is particularly fitting that Underwood should have chosen to step down in a year when the president of the Rugby Football Union is Peter Yarranton, himself a former England player and RAF pilot, who will be at today's game. 
Underwood's position as England's leading try-scorer, with 35 to his credit, has a two-fold RAF connection because when he scored against <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="ORG, sports, rugby team"> Ireland </location></annot> in 1990 the record he overtook had previously been held by another RAF pilot and winger, Cyril Lowe, who totalled 18 between 1913 and 1923 when winning 25 consecutive caps.

I admit to feeling a little dubious regarding the adequacy of these small filtration units and this was well-founded in some respects as I discovered that although the two models are described as 35 and 55 gallon capacity no mention is made in the advertising that this refers to US gallons not Imperial. 
This means that each of these filters only has a capacity of 80% of the size stated, in imperial gallon terms. 
I decided in the circumstances that the 35 US gallon model was hardly adequate for my purposes and traded up to the 55 <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot> gallon model. 
The general concept of the Biolife filter is good and there are some pretty advanced design features for such a relatively modestly priced filtration unit.

In the post-Reform Act election of December 1832 abolitionists published pledges from over 160 candidates; 132 pledged MPs were elected.

This was not done for imperial purposes, but once the navy had been developed it affected everything that happened in English policy. 
The government certainly had no money to spare to help the colonies, and this introduced the general rule that English colonies had to cover their own costs, both in the sense that the government of a colony had to raise enough revenue to pay its own bills and in the sense that there were no subsidies to encourage people to stay in a colony where they could not earn their own living. 
The result of these rules of practice was that the English set up colonies only in places where it was relatively easy to do so, at first because the places they went to were thinly populated, then because political disintegration in <annot><location reading="literal"> India </location></annot> enabled them to advance there, and because in the last phase of imperial expansion they had the sort of technological superiority needed for bringing most African rulers under their control. 
Because it was easy to launch them, a great diversity of colonies sprang up and usually they were neither compelled by any external danger nor persuaded by any liking for their neighbours to come to closer terms with one another.

By early 1973 it was clear that they would do little or nothing to protect the exchange rate from the impact of domestic policies, and indeed increasingly resented the attempts of European and Japanese central banks to prevent the dollar rate from finding its own level. 
Such a position would be quite incomprehensible if the main thrust of US policy was an attempt to run as large as possible a balance of payments deficit (on current and long-term capital account) in order to grab real resources from the rest of the world in exchange for paper dollars. 
On the contrary, given the heavy and increasing rate of capital exports, which was a major priority for many of the dominating US multinationals, it was far better from the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="underspecified between OFF, ORG"> United States </location></annot>' point of view that these capital exports should be mainly financed by a current account surplus rather than by endless piling up of US liabilities abroad to foreign central banks.

Taking the years 1956&ndash;70, if all (net) US direct investment overseas had instead been invested in the United States, gross private investment there would have increased only by around 4 per cent. 
Second, this investment abroad was not financed out of domestic profits; over the same period <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot> business received profits from its past investment overseas equivalent to around 1&frac14; times as much as it was sending overseas.

This is illustrated by Lijphart's (1984, 1989) analyses of types of democratic political systems, which was initially based on two dimensions reflecting different aspects of majoritarian and consensual rule. 
Fitting different political systems into this schema empirically involved defining the dimensions on the following variables. 
For the first dimension, five used were: whether executive power is concentrated (as in the British Cabinet) or shared (as in the Swiss Federal Council, in which all parties are represented); whether the executive dominates (as in the UK), or shares power with the legislature (as in the United States); whether there is a two or a multi-party system; whether parties are divided on one political dimension (e.g. the typical left-right division in Great Britain) or several (as in <annot><location reading="literal"> The Netherlands </location></annot>); and whether elections use plurality or proportional representation procedures. 
Together these measured the majoritarian-consensual dimension.

On the other hand, there is no law saying that librarianship, or teaching, or media production, can not be learned at professional level by people who already have a professional accreditation in another field.

In the <annot><location reading="literal"> USA </location></annot>, with its flexible and adaptable system of higher education and its tradition of easy access to university summer courses, it is common to meet teachers who have, over a period of time, gained professional competence in each field and become fully professional in every sense, able to talk on terms of complete parity with professional colleagues in each group. 
This situation would (as we shall see) be very desirable in the UK; some librarians, some teachers and some media specialists have painstakingly and at much personal cost gained dual or multiple status, and the extension of this practice would go far towards resolving unnecessary antagonisms between professional interest groups.

Indeed, one can only wonder that a deep, profoundly intelligent and inherently human European culture is retreating to the background before the primitive revelry of violence and pornography and the flow of cheap feelings and low thoughts. 
If this is what the Common European Home stands for, so enthusiastically embraced by the Germans on the occasion of Gorbachev's visit to Bonn in June 1989, then it is difficult to think of a more decisive rejection of the values of the Atlantic alliance. 
It is certainly a long way from the crowds cheering at John F.

Todd's interest in family structures was part of his search for an explanation of &bquo; the distribution of political ideologies, systems and forces on our planet &equo; (p. 1), which political science had significantly failed to provide.

As an example, he contends that &bquo; communism is a transference to the party state of the moral traits and the regulatory mechanisms of the exogamous community family &equo; (p. 33), so that the electoral success of communist parties had occurred only in areas dominated by that family type, whereas in <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot> &bquo; Socialism &hellip; follows on quite naturally from Catholicism &equo; (p. 86).

To concentrate on new legislation or the statutory repealing of the old is, however, to miss the point.

These circumstances are themselves historically changing, and in response to the changes new social movements and parties may emerge within the established political system, as did the socialist parties, and later the communist and fascist parties, in Europe. 
The success or failure of such third parties, or more generally of new parties, is affected by many social factors, as well as by the political system itself, including the electoral system. 
In the <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot>, for example, where the socialist party failed to establish itself as a major party after a fairly rapid growth in the first decade of this century, it has long been argued that the presidential system is a major obstacle to the development of third parties, and undoubtedly these constitutional factors have been important; but it is clear that many other social and economic characteristics of the US have had a preponderant influence in determining the absence of a large-scale independent socialist movement or party there (Sombart, 1906; Laslett and Lipset, 1974). 
In some European countries with a two-party system, in which the parties have traditionally been closely associated with the major classes in capitalist society, changes in the class structure &mdash; such as were examined in Chapter 1 &mdash; have made possible the emergence or revival of &bquo; centre &equo; parties, and changes of this kind may in due course have an impact upon the electoral system itself.

The compensation should be arranged at a European level, because sediment washed from the UK's east coast can end up strengthening natural sea defences in Belgium, the <annot><location reading="literal"> Netherlands </location></annot> and Germany. 
Global warming is contributing to rising sea levels around the world, according to Pethick, at the rate of about one millimetre a year.

Although an indefinite curfew was reimposed in Srinagar after the assassination, thousands of people took to the streets as Farooq's body was carried from the hospital to which it had been taken to his home. 
As the cortege passed Srinagar's Islamia College precinct, Indian security forces opened fire on the mourners, killing at least 20 people on the spot; a further 27 people were subsequently killed, and according to some reports the death toll had reached 100 by the end of the day. 
After Farooq's assassination and the subsequent shootings, both <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> India </location></annot> and Pakistan initiated substantial and aggressive troop movements, and The Hindu of May 31 reported that the two countries &quot; came close to war &quot; on May 22. 
The incident brought to an end a month-long period of peace in Kashmir, and dashed hopes of a reduction in the border tension.

On the other hand, there was much to be commended in the way Britain relinquished the reins of empire. 
Beginning with the transfer of power in India and Pakistan in 1947, through the retreat from Egypt, and the rapid withdrawal from Africa in the Macleod period in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rapidity and lack of tension with which Britain shed her imperial domain is perhaps the most notable of tributes to national stability and, possibly, maturity in the post-war world.

The younger enthusiasts of revolution, those who fervently accepted the ideals of The Green Book, seemed not to recognize the hard political work of the administrators nor to pay much attention to such discrepancies between ideology and practice as forced themselves into the consciousness of Libyans with wider experience of the ways of government. 
So it was only on rare occasions that the issue of local sovereignty arose: usually when a person &mdash; a single individual &mdash; got carried away by indignation or by enthusiasm to raise points which prudent men, a little weary of what they considered to be rhetoric, tended to suppress. 
The 1979 local Assemblies throughout the country debated Libya's relations with <annot><location reading="literal"> Malta </location></annot>; they were to advise on the question whether Libya should give economic aid to her ally. 
In Ajdabiya a young man, Wunis Abdulhadi, the brother of the lawyer Abdulsalam Abdulhadi, pointed out that The Financial Times had already announced the formation of Libyan-financed joint enterprises and that the government had given months ago; he concluded there was no point in discussing the issue.

The rise of the &bquo; multinationals &equo; has received much comment and I shall not go into great detail here. 
What is of particular interest is that direct investment overseas by such enterprises has become increasingly important over the post war years (as opposed to portfolio investment, of which British capital has a long tradition), and that this phenomenon is especially important for the British economy. 
In 1971 the <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot> was second only to the USA as a home base for multinational companies; overseas production by British-based multinationals as a proportion of domestic output in 1977 was, at 40 per cent, higher than the corresponding figure for any other national economy except Switzerland; and in 1971 nearly 20 per cent of UK output was produced by overseas based companies. 
Both &bquo; foreign &equo; multinationals operating within Britain and British enterprises with substantial overseas production facilities can &bquo; plan &equo; the international distribution of their profit-making taking into account comparative costs, the state and growth rate of national markets and the degree of militancy or subordination of labour.

Although <annot><location reading="literal"> South Korea </location></annot> recorded a growth rate of 9.1 per cent in 1990, this was achieved largely through a boom in the construction industry manufactured by a government-backed residential building programme which aimed to construct 2,500,000 new housing units in 1988-92. 
Increased levels of domestic consumption (including expenditure on luxury items), however, suggested that a more fundamental shift was under way whereby the dynamic of the South Korean economy was changing from one which was export-led to one based upon domestic demand.

The solution in Cunningham's own school (Madeley Court, Telford) was a sophisticated library resource centre, on two levels, with a multi-media collection of materials, reprographic and audiovisual production facilities, and trunking to the library and other areas of the school through which audio-programmes could be distributed on command. 
Naturally, the facility required ancillary staffing in all areas, as well as a teacher as Head of Resources with a curriculum development brief. 
At the time this was perhaps the most lavishly equipped school of its kind in the UK (though there were many more lavish examples still in the richer areas of the <annot><location reading="literal"> USA </location></annot>) but its strength was to be the participation of its library resource centre personnel and the head of resources in the in-service education of the teachers.

But by the end of 1978 the French had decided that the sooner the Shah left Iran the better. 
In the first week of January 1979, President Gidacred d &quot; estain expounded his view when he met for a summit conference with Jimmy Carter, Hemut Schmidt, the West German chancellor, and James Callaghan, the British prime minister, on the French West Indian island of Guadeloupe. * 
By the time they had reached <annot><location reading="literal"> Morocco </location></annot>, the Shah and the Queen both believed that Giscard had betrayed them personally at Guadeloupe. 
It was something they talked about frequently.

No matter what reservations Churchill might have entertained about the Atlantic Charter and whether or not freedom was meant to apply to colonial territories, the unworthiness of France to return to Indochina was soon to become one of Roosevelt's fixed ideas on colonialism and an issue that would bedevil relations between all the Allied powers in Southeast Asia with the possible and ironic exception of the Soviet Union. 
At least Churchill is on record that Roosevelt had been more outspoken with him on the subject of Indochina than on any other colonial matter: &bquo; I imagine it is one of his principal war aims to liberate Indochina from France &equo;. 
And while Roosevelt was to some extent restrained by the State Department and, even more, after the US had recognized de Gaulle's government in October, 1944, by considerations of reconstituting <annot><location reading="literal"> France </location></annot> as at least a European power, there was, on the operational level, a situation developing in southern China, in which the US was involved, which would affect the fortunes of the Vietnamese revolutionaries, their appearance, their standing with other Vietnamese patriots, and their ability to influence future events. 
Shortly after the US had entered the war Ho's personal fortunes had reached their lowest ebb.

Espionage convictions 
A Basel court on March 17, 1989, found a computer specialist guilty of passing economic information to the Soviet Union and sentenced him to 45 days in prison. 
According to a government report published on Aug. 9, cases of espionage in <annot><location reading="literal"> Switzerland </location></annot> involving agents from Eastern Europe continued to increase; 65 of the 91 cases recorded from 1980 to 1988 involved these countries, most of which desired technological rather than political or security information, and over the same period 17 of the 24 diplomats and officials expelled were from Eastern Europe. 
Three Soviet diplomats at the UN secretariat in Geneva were in April 1990 barred from re-entering the country for attempting to collect confidential technological information.

To my taste, none of these have a particularly distinctive flavour, but the quality in texture is immediately obvious. 
The best of these sausages are loose or in jars &mdash; I find that the necessary temperatures achieved during canning tend to make the sausages rather fatty and slimy in texture.

I sell most of the French variety, which is a small sausage with a strong flavour but a coarse and fatty texture.

A museum of economic botany was opened in 1847, and in later decades Kew played a vital role in the spread of useful plants around the British empire. 
In the United States a national botanical garden was founded to exploit the seeds and plants brought back by a Pacific exploration expedition under Charles Wilkes in the years 1838&ndash;42. 
At the same time the <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot> Patent Office became interested in the possibility of using tropical plants to revive the agriculture of the southern states. 
The Patent Office also promoted the use of chemistry in soil analysis, seeing this as a means of preventing the exhaustion of nutrients.

Bush said that he would be willing to lift US sanctions once the Pretoria government had fulfilled conditions including the total lifting of the state of emergency. 
Earlier, Mandela had been forthright in his criticism of US support for the Angolan rebel movement UNITA &lsqb; see p. 37523 &rsqb;. 
In the course of his visit Mandela addressed Congress and travelled to other US cities which had taken a strong anti-apartheid stance, including Atlanta, <annot><location reading="literal"> Georgia </location></annot>, where he visited the tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther King. 
Mandela had what was by all accounts a successful meeting with the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on July 4, describing her afterwards as an &quot; enemy of apartheid &quot;.

Boyden followed Spencer Stuart in 1965&ndash;6 but has suffered varying business fortunes since then. 
Few of Boyden's early British headhunters have survived to the present, and its level of business declined and failed to take off significantly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
For instance, during 1979, with three consultants only 30 placements were achieved in the <annot><location reading="literal"> UK </location></annot>, compared with Egon Zehnder's 80 and Spencer Stuart's 170 in the same year. 
The number of placements had marginally increased by 1981 to 40.

In addition, many rural areas were traversed by the rail network, which gave them an additional lifeline and a link with main centres. 
As Thomas (1963) wrote, people were affected by trains to some extent even in the most remote parts of England during the latter half of the nineteenth and early years of the twentieth centuries. 
By the time of the First World War, an enormous number of quite small villages and hamlets had their own wayside station or halt, and at its peak <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot>'s railway system was (to Thomas) &bquo; almost absurdly dense &equo;. 
The major reason given for the closure of railway lines and stations was that the 1950s modernization plan for the railways had had little effect on stemming an ever-rising deficit in running costs.

The Iranian election is seen as an opportunity for President Rafsanjani to strengthen his pragmatic policy of seeking an accommodation with the West to restore Iran's economy. 
But Mr Rafsanjani is exposed to accusations that he is departing from the policies set out by the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, and may have seized on the Mujahideen attacks to demonstrate that he is not selling out the imam's legacy. 
<annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> Britain </location></annot> has not yet received any formal demand for the extradition of the demonstrators who threw bricks at the Iranian embassy in London and smashed windows. 
There is no extradition treaty between Iran and Britain, though this does not rule out granting a request, if properly formulated.
